This repository contains all the .log files resulting from the exhaustive tests carried out by the K-Bench (performance) and Kube-Bench (security) benchmark tool.
The resulting analysis was explained in detail in the scientific article published at the IEEE Melecom 2024 conference.
In addition to the graphs presented in the article, in this repository it is possible to find equivalent figures for 1, 4, 8, 16, 20 and 24 pods and for 5, 20, 40, 80, 100 and 120 pods for each of the K0s distributions , K3s and K8s.
